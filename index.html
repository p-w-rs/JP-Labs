                    Powers Labs is a for-profit LLC registered in Utah, founded
                    by <strong>Joshua Powers</strong>, who currently serves as
                    the principal researcher. We're in our early stages and
                    growing steadily as we secure more research grants and
                    consulting projects.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Our mission is to pursue

                    than derivative or incremental work. We believe in creating
                    meaningful advancements that contribute to both academic
                    knowledge and practical applications.
